### Testing
To start create a folder on your Desktop named 'TEST' and put in any files you want destroyed.
Compile and run the program using Visual Studio 2017 and make sure the target C# framework is version 4.6 (version 2.0 is also possible).
The encryption algorithm uses streams, so it should be able to handle files larger than 4GB.
